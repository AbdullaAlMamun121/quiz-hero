            <p class="text-xs italic mt-1 mb-4 text-orange-800 text-center">
                Modern browsers offer two storage options that let site designers store data on the client-side:
                localStorage and sessionStorage. However there are some significant variations between the two.

                Data scope and lifetime: The key distinction between localStorage and sessionStorage is the data scope
                and lifetime that is kept in storage.

                localStorage: Data stored with localStorage is kept on the user's device even when the browser window is
                closed. Any JavaScript script from the same domain is able to access it.

                SessionStorage: Data stored in a session is only accessible during that particular session. The data is
                thus only accessible while the browser window or tab is active. The data is lost if the user closes the
                tab or window.

            <h2 class="text-md text-gray-800 text-center">Q=>(3). What is event loop and
                how does it's work in js?</h2>
            <p class="text-xs italic mt-1 mb-4 text-orange-800 text-center">
                JavaScript's concurrency model relies on the event loop, a fundamental idea that gives JavaScript the
                ability to handle asynchronous actions. In the JavaScript runtime, it is in charge of controlling how
                code is executed and making sure that no code is running in the background at the same time as another.


                Due to the fact that JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, only one piece of code may be
                run at once. Yet it also has an event-driven architecture, allowing it to react to timers, network
                requests, and user interactions, among other events. The event loop controls how quickly the code
                handling these events runs because it is handled asynchronously.

                The JavaScript runtime's task queue and call stack are continuously inspected by the event loop.
                The JavaScript runtime maintains a record of the execution of function calls in a data structure known
                as the call stack. The top of the call stack is increased when a function is called, and it is
                decremented when it returns.

                A queue of jobs that must be carried out is kept in a data structure called the task queue. A job is
                produced and added to the task queue whenever an event takes place, such as when a user clicks a button
                or a network request is finished.

                Checking the call stack and task queue continually is the function of the event loop.
                The first task from the task queue is added to the call stack when it is empty, and the task's
                associated code is then executed. The event loop keeps checking the call stack and task queue if there
                are no tasks in the task queue until one is created.

                What is the main thought of QuizeTimer() function?
            </h2>
            <p class="text-xs italic mt-1 mb-4 text-orange-800 text-center">
                The argument to the quizTimer function is a boolean parameter named dismiss. The goal of this function
                is to start or stop a timer that keeps track of the passing seconds, refreshes the webpage's count
                display every second, and switches the count display's color every 60 seconds.

                If dismiss is true, the method uses clearInterval(timer) to reset the timer and doesn't return anything.
                The timer will stop ticking if you do this.


                Using setInterval(), the code creates a timer that runs a callback function every 1000 milliseconds if
                dismiss is false (or not specified) (1 second). The callback function increments the count by 1 and
                refreshes the count display on the webpage every 60 seconds. It also changes the color of the count
                display.

                What is the main thought of chooseQuiz() function?
            </h2>
            <p class="text-xs italic mt-1 mb-4 text-orange-800 text-center">
                The index and givenAns parameters are required for this function, chooseQuiz.

                A quiz question's index can be found in the quizData array as the first parameter, and the user-selected
                answer can be found in the second argument, givenAns.

                The function first looks in the responses array for an object whose id property matches the id property
                of the quiz question at the provided index in quizData. This is accomplished by utilizing the
                Array.find() method, which yields the array's initial element that meets the given testing function. If
                an item with the specified id property is discovered,
                The function uses the Array.splice() method to replace the existing object with a new object created by spreading the properties of the quiz question at the specified index and adding the givenAns property. This indicates that the user has already answered this question, and it updates the existing answer object in the answers array with the new answer. The function pushes a new object to the answers array using the spread operator to create an object that contains all the properties of the quiz question at the specified index as well as the givenAns property if no object with a matching id property is found, indicating that the user is answering this question for the first time.
